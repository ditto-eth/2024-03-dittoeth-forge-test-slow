GM! 
Hello @dittoproj , just want to make sure, does that mean there are parts of the codebase that are new and haven't been audited before? and all findings from the codehawk contest have been mitigated?


[03/15/2024 20:19] dittoproj
not sure if anyone participated in my last audit with codehawks, but a lot of it is building on top of that yeah


[03/15/2024 20:19] Deleted User
wehere exactly is ``interfaces`` dir ?  in remappings it says about ``interfaces``  but  it doesnt contain all the interfaces like  ``IRocketStorage.sol``


[03/15/2024 20:21] Deleted User
is  it ``contracts/interfaces/``  or there is another one with the rest of interfaces  ?


[03/15/2024 20:21] 0xdemonnn
great, thanks :thankyou:


[03/15/2024 20:22] dittoproj
not sure if everything is mitigated per se but i tried to address issues I thought were worth doing, a good amount of it is related to things brought up in the past audit! (example would be better handling a minimum ercAmount especially for a ShortRecord)

[03/15/2024 20:23] dittoproj
good question, it will probably be asked a lot - hopefully I put this in the readme already but `interfaces/` is generated with a script but I tried to add that in already


[03/15/2024 20:25] Deleted User
``bun run interfaces-force`` ??


[03/15/2024 20:25] dittoproj
oh it didn't get added because it's usually in the gitignore, yes exactly
`bun run interfaces-force` creates the folder and corresponds to potentially each file in contracts


[03/15/2024 20:26] dittoproj
if you are setting up the repo for the first time I would go through the steps under the tests section

check this out, a pretty good explanation of the overall system lifecycle


[03/17/2024 07:24] cosine_function
@dittoproj there are some functions missing which are mentioned in the docs and existed during the codehawks audit like for example the flagshort function mentioned in the System Lifecycle can not be found in the PrimaryLiquidationFacet (https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/blob/main/contracts/facets/PrimaryLiquidationFacet.sol)

So I guess the docs were not updated to reflect the new changes?

[03/17/2024 12:30] nmirchev8
So if future you plan to support LST different from `reth` and `steth` and their bridges  would be added to `s.bridge` mapping?

Thanks


[03/18/2024 14:02] dittoproj
you may need to skip the fork tests or pick a different RPC url


[03/18/2024 14:03] dittoproj
quick answer is yield comes from the LSTs, since you come in with an LST


[03/18/2024 14:03] dittoproj
filler is a placeholder in the struct, just to track how many slots


[03/18/2024 14:04] dittoproj
not sure what this means? what about it is the same? they are in same in some ways like both people bring in eth?


[03/18/2024 14:04] dittoproj
can you copy the way I did it in the other tests? maybe check remappings and the syntax you use


[03/18/2024 14:05] dittoproj
still in the process of cleaning up docs, at least in https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#high-level-changes it should mention what changed like flagging being removed

[03/18/2024 14:06] guy_in0xnito
No no i got it 
It was a dumb question
Haven't seen any orderbook before so asked that

But on another note since 
Ask orders is not in scope 
But there are some related logic to that o think in bidorders so what about those ?

{Reactions}
👍 

[03/18/2024 14:08] dittoproj
contracts are in https://dittoeth.com/contracts, but you can maybe ctrl f the existing tests to get a sense of how to write them. you shouldn't have to set up everything from scratch. I have helpers like obfixture and helper functions in testfacet/viewfacet


[03/18/2024 14:08] dittoproj
yes it would be rethbridge/stethbridge, i would search " is IBridge" in the codebase

{Reactions}
👍 

[03/18/2024 14:09] dittoproj
I just didn't include it to save scope but liborders and bidorders are in scope, the ask orders is just calling the helpers


[03/18/2024 14:10] mladenov0603
When you have time can you please check the private thread


[03/18/2024 14:11] dittoproj
yeah something like that, via ownerfacet.createBridge. no plans to immediately do that but diff vault can support diff kinds of lsts. currently just 2 because of potential issues around arbitrage between the 2 so probably won't have more than 2 in a single vault, or make a separate one with only that LST

[03/18/2024 15:42] dittoproj
for the most part yes and tried to call them out here in the changes column: https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#scope


[03/18/2024 16:19] dittoproj
although looking at it again, I didn't see where the flagging was mentioned, I don't see it so maybe you saw an old version since I definitely removed it - if you do see it share me a link and I can remove @Cosine


[03/18/2024 17:10] guy_in0xnito
So is the maximum number of orders that can be made are 65k?

As mentioned it is in the System Lifecycle page of the docs (https://dittoeth.com/overview/lifecycle):

Shorts that have fallen below the primaryLiquidationCR must first be flagged for liquidation using flagShort in PrimaryLiquidationFacet ...


[03/19/2024 13:58] 0xgreywolf
Hi @dittoproj. I'm quite confused with the definition of shorting here. In traditional finance, shorting means selling an asset that is not yours (means it is borrowed). Is it the same? Or in protocol's context, are shorts just "sellers" and longs are just "buyers" and the order book matches them? Thank you.

@dittoproj in the example provided here : https://dittoeth.com/technical/ob#shorter-yield, `initialCR == 2`, 
(1 from shorter **+** 1 from bidder), where does the other +1 come from `price * amount * (initialCR + 1)` ?

"The +1 is what gives the shorter extra yield for matching against a bid order, which results in 1 / initialCR extra yield."


[03/19/2024 21:01] dittoproj
Meaning the dusd bidder provides the +1

ercDebt is the Dusd debt?

{Reactions}
👍 

[03/20/2024 07:21] evokid
yes sir -)
`The shortRecord saves the amount of debt the user owes in ercDebt, as well as the current collateral.`
https://dittoeth.com/technical/ob#shortrecord

As the Debt position is the dUSD
`This system uses an orderbook to match buy and sell sides (thus two sided) to create a stable asset. A buyer takes their ETH with the intent of getting the stable asset (dUSD, Ditto USD). A shorter takes their ETH with the intent of getting the yield of their collateral in addition to the extra collateral of the buyer as well as taking a lended sell position against USD. The orderbook model allows for the shorter to be incredibly efficient with their provided collateral.`

yes, erc meaning there could be other stable assets/coins but referring to the only one currently, dusd

{Reactions}
thankyou 

[03/20/2024 14:01] dittoproj
can you be more specific about what you are confused by? I can't help you other than repeating the docs in some form
https://dittoeth.com/technical/ob#order-hints
the orders have to be sorted, and orders are in a mapping. it's a doubly linked list. it's expensive to sort on chain because you have to loop over x times to find the correct place to place an order based on sorted price. the hint is the id that tells the system where to place the new order
orders are referenced by id in the mapping, so the hint tells the system where it goes

[03/20/2024 14:35] dittoproj
if anyone needs help with writing tests let me know as well, i setup helpers in the the current tests that you should be able to use to call things in the diamond and elsewhere, so existing tests should be a helpful guide


[03/20/2024 17:13] guy_in0xnito
I personally think some variables name in one place
Since scope of the audit doesn't contain the variables




And on other note what does 
'accessDeth'  function mean ?


[03/20/2024 17:17] tychaios.
Are you referring to `assessDeth` in `LibBridgeRouter.sol`?


[03/20/2024 17:20] guy_in0xnito
Ya


[03/20/2024 17:37] dittoproj
everything in datatypes/appstorage is in scope in the sense that every file references them so i wasn't sure if that was necessary to say, but the issues should be in the logic of how they are used I would think

{Reactions}
✅ 

[03/20/2024 17:38] dittoproj
`assessDeth` is related to the feature about bridge credit/arb

Fix issues related to withdrawals (see "finding-579" L-13. Instant arbitrage opportunity through rETH and stETH price discrepancy): introduce a "credit" system for when LST (rETH/stETH) is deposited to handle arbitrage between depositing and withdrawing. Users can only withdraw what type of LST they deposit with. Any extra withdrawals due to yield gain will be given based on checking the oracle price difference between the LSTs.

also wrote about it here https://dittoeth.com/technical/arbitrage

basically if you come in with stETH, you can take out that much stETH etc, but if you make trades or gain yield it may do extra checks. this is to deal with mixing the assets, which you are feel to disagree with or say it's not a big deal


[03/20/2024 17:46] noro9954
@dittoproj what this value refers to : https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/blob/main/contracts/libraries/Constants.sol#L15


[03/20/2024 17:47] dittoproj
oh this is bid collateral ratio, it's just a constant that refers to 100%, or 100% CR. the bid is providing 1 for 1 eth for the dusd at whatever price. the shorter can provide the other side of the collateral to make it over-collateralized


[03/20/2024 17:52] noro9954
can the shorter provide collateral less than initialCR and the bidder complets the remaining to reach initialCR ?
for example` intialCR = 170`, shorter provide `70` when creating the limit short and bidder provides `100 `when the order matchs . is that possible ?

yep you got it, https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/blob/91faf46078bb6fe8ce9f55bcb717e5d2d302d22e/contracts/facets/ShortOrdersFacet.sol#L51 if you read this part

(shortOrderCR + C.BID_CR) < Asset.initialCR
it's doing what you said, short side CR could be say 70% and bid side is 100% and it can be >= initialCR depending on how low it gets set. this is so that a shorter could provide a lot less CR

yep, escrow is just for the accounting, since it's not a swap that happens immediately. there's one for each erc asset (the stablecoin dusd), and there's one for everything that is deposited via eth/reth/steth

Amount of collateral dETH by shorter ?


[03/22/2024 15:26] dittoproj
it's just the generic variable for any collateral for any user, could be a bidder too, depends on what you want to do. it's just the variable that increases when you deposit


[03/22/2024 20:16] samuraii77

[03/22/2024 20:56] mike_bello90
ask and short are the same right?


[03/22/2024 21:58] dittoproj
no asks and shorts are not the same thing but they are on the same side of the orderbook  (i.e. match with a bidder). but they are completely different


[03/22/2024 21:59] dittoproj
https://dittoeth.com/technical/ob#short-orders
asks are when you are selling the stable asset (selling dusd)
shorts are a debt position (you don't have the dusd, you owe it)

it might be from `forge fmt` or if you have `juanblanco.solidity` extension installed (I do), @klau5 suggestion is good, or you can change the foundry.toml line length even higher


[03/25/2024 16:21] dittoproj
say you deposit 10 stETH and try to withdraw 10 stETH at a later time. Normally you would receive 10 stETH fee free (since you have 10 stETH bridge credit). In the rare/unlikely case that the stETH bridge contract has no stETH remaining you would be able to withdraw 10 stETH equivalent of rETH fee free since that is the only LST remaining

my pc is not supporting bun, how could i run test then


[03/26/2024 19:43] dittoproj
oh ok, for windows you can download a canary version but you can also just use npm instead, it's just to run js commands
https://bun.sh/docs/installation#windows is a canary build of bun

or anytime you see `bun run x` maybe `npm run x`, or just run the commands directly from package.json


[03/26/2024 19:46] dittoproj
I choose not to do gas because I wanted wardens to focus on security. I did a lot for gas already and don't want to prioritize smaller gas wins over security


[03/26/2024 19:49] dittoproj
for tests specifically you can use forge commands like `forge test`
I left some alliases in the readme as well

```
alias t="forge test "
alias tm="forge test --match-test "
alias ts="forge test --match-test statefulFuzz"
alias gm="FOUNDRY_PROFILE=gas forge build && FOUNDRY_PROFILE=testgas forge test --match-test "
```


[03/26/2024 19:53] dittoproj
for anyone looking at the bridge credit system and confused about why it's there, i'd be curious to know alternatives to how to deal with arbitrage between different LSTs since the pool is mixed. seems like either you don't mix it (separate each LST like other protocols) or need to track each LST via credit

[03/28/2024 08:04] .0xsecuri
@dittoproj What is the purpose of having an oracle address in the Asset struct? The inline docs mention 'for non-USD assets,' but I'm struggling to understand how this is expected to work.


[03/28/2024 09:35] guy_in0xnito
Nope Asking about this 
'difference between the match price and the cached oracle price is greater than 0.5%,'

What you are talking about is this ithink 

"The price deviation circuit breaker is triggered when the delta between the saved oracle price and the incoming Chainlink price is greater than 50% in either direction"

baseOracle is always the ETH/USD chainlink oracle. currently the system only has a usd asset, but it allows for more assets in the future (yen, rmb, gold…etc etc). that is why each asset will have its own oracle saved into their struct, while the baseOracle is the same across all assets

[03/28/2024 17:00] .0xsecuri
Just to clarify, these oracles will also be Chainlink oracles, right?

Like this one for example: https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/cny-usd


[03/28/2024 17:25] dittoproj
yes


[03/28/2024 18:09] dittoproj
but that's a future thing, other oracles have different parameters so it's known that there could be potential differences if I want to add them later

If the get dethValue is less than < rounding zero is it that  the steth bridge has no value or is empty?

Anyone


[03/29/2024 16:18] dittoproj
in the case of stETH the getDethValue call is just balanceOf, so the bridge would be empty in that case (Although for rebasing token i believe no value and empty are the same thing)

[03/29/2024 17:11] dittoproj
and what do you mean by threshold? like a limit on what the price can be?


[03/29/2024 18:29] alchmy952
Yes


[03/29/2024 18:59] dittoproj
there isn't a limit on price per se, it is expected to have one?
that would be limited by a person's ethEscrowed (if price is too high, they wouldn't have enough eth), and ShortOrders only match at oracle price


[03/29/2024 22:07] alchmy952
For the sake of clarity, why wouldn't they have enough Eth if the price is too high?


[03/30/2024 17:29] dittoproj
it depends on the ercAmount

[03/31/2024 10:47] modey__
hello @dittoproj . Please can you drop some insight on bridge credits ? is bridgecreditReth the amount of Reth a vault user has deposited?


[04/01/2024 02:19] dittoproj
were you able to look at https://dittoeth.com/technical/arbitrage? kind of, the short of it is that if you deposit either lst you get that credit and when you withdraw it removes it but there's more to it


[04/01/2024 02:20] dittoproj
this is in a liquidation, need to leave some room to make sure the ShortRecord can be exited, so the price is higher than usual, otherwise it might not be matched
```
        // @dev Provide higher price to better ensure it can fully fill the liquidation
        uint80 _bidPrice = m.oraclePrice.mulU80(m.forcedBidPriceBuffer);
```

@dittoproj, is the s.assets[asset].oracle for USD asset again Chainlink's ETH/USD oracle?


[04/03/2024 15:23] dittoproj
no, i would check the datatypes https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/blob/91faf46078bb6fe8ce9f55bcb717e5d2d302d22e/contracts/libraries/DataTypes.sol#L121
this is unused at the moment but there's a placeholder spot for other oracles in the future if the system adds other assets. this is under "asset" so it makes sense the oracle would be for that asset

https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/blob/91faf46078bb6fe8ce9f55bcb717e5d2d302d22e/contracts/libraries/AppStorage.sol#L14 the baseOracle is the eth/usd oracle

@dittoproj why in "partial liquidation" the leftover short is absorbed by TAPP? What is the purpose of having TAPP absorb the surplus? Can't it be left as it is for others to finish liquidating?


[04/04/2024 15:25] dittoproj
that only happens when the loseCollateral condition is met bc of low CR: <https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-03-dittoeth/blob/91faf46078bb6fe8ce9f55bcb717e5d2d302d22e/contracts/facets/PrimaryLiquidationFacet.sol#L263>

when SR is under the penaltyCR the shorter is dangerously close to (or already) undercollateralization so the TAPP assumes the risky debt and consolidates it into one place to make liquidations easier.
